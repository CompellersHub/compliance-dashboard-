Ideologically a Nigerian nationalist, he was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from 1998 to 2015, and since 2018.\n\nBorn in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba, Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta, Ogun State. He joined the Nigerian Army and specialised in engineering and served in the Congo, Britain, and India, rising to the rank of Major. In the late 1960s, he played a major role in combating Biafran separatists during the Nigerian Civil War, accepting their surrender in 1970. In 1975, a military coup established a junta with Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate. After the triumvirate's leader, Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated the following year, the Supreme Military Council[3] appointed Obasanjo as Head of State. Continuing Murtala's policies, Obasanjo oversaw budgetary cut-backs and an expansion of access to free school education. Increasingly aligning Nigeria with the United States, he also emphasised support for groups opposing white minority rule in southern Africa. Committed to restoring democracy, Obasanjo oversaw the 1979 election, after which he transferred control of Nigeria to the newly elected civilian president, Shehu Shagari. Obasanjo then retired to Ota, Ogun, where he became a farmer, published four books, and took part in international initiatives to end various African conflicts.\n\nIn 1993, Sani Abacha seized power in a military coup. Obasanjo was openly critical of Abacha's administration and in 1995 was arrested and convicted of being part of a planned coup, despite protesting his innocence. While imprisoned, he became a born again Christian, with providentialism strongly influencing his subsequent worldview. He was released following Abacha's death in 1998. Obasanjo entered electoral politics, becoming the PDP candidate for the 1999 presidential election which he won. As president, he de-politicised the military and both expanded the police and mobilised the army to combat widespread ethnic, religious, and secessionist violence. He withdrew Nigeria's military from Sierra Leone and privatized various public enterprises to limit the country's spiraling debt. He was re-elected in the 2003 election. Influenced by Pan-Africanist ideas, he was a keen supporter of the formation of the African Union and served as its chair from 2004 to 2006. Obasanjo's attempts to change the constitution to abolish presidential term limits were unsuccessful and brought criticism. After retiring, he earned a PhD in theology from the National Open University of Nigeria.[4]",

He returned to Nigeria in the 1980s and was employed by Mobil Nigeria as an accountant, before entering politics as a Lagos West senatorial candidate in 1992 under the banner of the Social Democratic Party. After the military dictator Sani Abacha dissolved the Senate in 1993, Tinubu went into exile and became an activist campaigning for the return of democracy as a part of the National Democratic Coalition movement.\n\nIn the first post-transition Lagos State gubernatorial election, Tinubu won by a wide margin as a member of the Alliance for Democracy. Four years later, he won re-election to a second term. After leaving office in 2007, he played a key role in forming the All Progressives Congress in 2013. In 2023, he was elected president, defeating Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi.",

It also contains a life-size statue of Madam Tinubu on a cenotaph.[5] The size of the square is 2,000 square meters.[6] The square was last remodeled in 2017 by the Lagos state government.[7]",

            "extract": "tinyBuild Inc. is an American publisher of indie games based in Bellevue, Washington.[2] The company was established by Alex Nichiporchik and Tom Brien in 2011 to expand Brien's game No Time to Explain into a commercial release. Building from the success of the game's Steam release in 2013, tinyBuild partnered with DoubleDutch Games for the development and release of SpeedRunners, which landed tinyBuild further publishing deals. Since March 2020, the company has been founding or acquiring new studios to expand. It became a public company on the Alternative Investment Market in March 2021.\n\ntinyBuild was founded in 2011 by Alex Nichiporchik (Latvian: Aleksandrs Ņičiporčiks) and Tom Brien.[3][4] Nichiporchik came from Latvia and had been a professional Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos player in the early 2000s, which made him enough money to drop out of high school and pursue a career in video game journalism.[5] While an employee of Spil Games in the Netherlands in 2010, he became interested in Flash games. He came across Super Meat Boy, which led to him to want to get into the business. Nichiporchik discovered No Time to Explain, a Flash game by Tom Brien, which he thought could be as successful as Super Meat Boy. Nichiporchik and Brien established tinyBuild in 2011 as a developer to expand No Time to Explain into a commercial release. The company headquarters were based in the Netherlands with Nichiporchik until both relocated to Seattle later on.[3]\n\ntinyBuild launched a crowdfunding campaign for the game via Kickstarter and raised US$26,000 from a $7,000 target.[3] tinyBuild had agreed with the Russian publisher Buka Entertainment that the latter would publish retail versions of No Time to Explain in Russia, get the game released on Steam, and grant tinyBuild $24,500 in royalties in advance. However, Buka Entertainment failed to communicate with tinyBuild until stating that it was forced to cancel the project, withholding the royalties.[6][7] As No Time to Explain could not be launched via Steam, tinyBuild released it independently. The game recouped its development cost but did not turn a significant profit. tinyBuild went into hiatus for nearly a year thereafter until Steam introduced the Greenlight process for game approval. No Time to Explain became one of the first games to be greenlit for Steam in 2013 and had a successful release on the platform. Nichiporchik stated this experience burnt out tinyBuild, which was no longer interested in pursuing development but did not want to waste the newfound success. The company invested in, co-developed, and published the game SpeedRunners, which led to more developers pitching their games to tinyBuild, incrementally turning the company into a publisher.[3] To expand its publishing operations, it hired the video game journalist Mike Rose in December 2014.[8]",

It is the capital of the Tombouctou Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali, having a population of 32,460 in the 2018 census.\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests prehistoric settlements in the region, predating the city's Islamic scholarly and trade prominence in the medieval period. Timbuktu began as a seasonal settlement and became permanent early in the 12th century. After a shift in trading routes, particularly after the visit by Mansa Musa around 1325, Timbuktu flourished, due to its strategic location, from the trade in salt, gold, and ivory. It gradually expanded as an important Islamic city on the Saharan trade route and attracted many scholars and traders before it became part of the Mali Empire early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century, the Tuareg people took control for a short period, until the expanding Songhai Empire absorbed it in 1468.\n\nA Moroccan army defeated the Songhai in 1591 and made Timbuktu their capital. The invaders established a new ruling class, the Arma, who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. In its golden age, the town's Islamic scholars and extensive trade network supported an important book trade. Together with the campuses of the Sankoré Madrasah, an Islamic university, this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and Leo Africanus, wrote about the city. These stories fuelled speculation in Europe, where the city's reputation shifted from being rich to mysterious. The city's golden age as a major learning and cultural centre of the Mali Empire was followed by a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the French took over Mali in 1893, in a regime that lasted until the country became the Republic of Mali in 1960.",

The article on Trump's tariffs suggests potential economic inefficiencies and reputational risks associated with trade policies, while the piece on West African terrorism highlights security and geopolitical concerns, which could involve regulatory or military responses. Overall, the sentiment varies from critical in the economic context to celebratory in cultural achievements, with potential compliance risks primarily related to trade sanctions and security measures.",

This event took place between 29 March and 6 April 1919, in an area controlled by the Romanian Army on behalf of the Governing Council, during the period of assurance by the Romanian troops, from a military point of view, of the Transylvanian demarcation line.\n\nThe rebellion was triggered as a result of a misinterpretation of an official information transmitted during the period of dysfunction associated with the taking the oath of allegiance to the Romanian state. In addition, the rioters erroneously relied on the military support of the \"Secuian Division\", support that it was unable to provide.\n\nThe population of the area did not react unitedly, only a small number of villages rose up against the existing order, and they could secure, according to Szekeres Lukács Sándor, only a number of about 200 armed men. After the initial stage, in which the local gendarmes were overwhelmed, the intervention of the regular troops of the Kingdom of Romania restored the initial situation.",

In the April 2007 national elections, he was the Action Congress candidate for the Osun East Senatorial seat.\nThe election was marred by electoral malpractices and violence and was nullified in October 2009 by the Court of Appeal, Ibadan.\nOmoworare and Action Congress in Osun State abstained from the rerun election of 23 December 2009.[1]",

He lives and works in Nigeria.[7]\n\nBabajide Olatunji hails from Okitipupa, Ondo State, Nigeria and was born in Port Harcourt in 1989 to Samuel Adeyemi Olatunji; a civil servant father, and Florence Omolola Olatunji; a petty-trading mother.

His years in power, colloquially known as the Babangida Era,[3] are considered one of the most controversial in Nigerian political and military history, being characterized by a burgeoning political culture of corruption in Nigeria,[4] with Babangida and his regime estimated to have misappropriated at least 12 billion dollars (23.9 billion today).[5]\n\nThe Babangida regime oversaw the establishment of a state security apparatus, survived two coup d'état attempts, and the subsequent execution of Mamman Vatsa (1985) and Gideon Orkar (1990) alongside the trial of hundreds of soldiers. The Babangida era also witnessed the assassination in Lagos of a prominent journalist named Dele Giwa (1986).[6] The regime also faced a series of ethnic and religious outbreaks related to the fallout of Babangida's decision to increase cooperation with the Muslim world and rise in extremist tendencies. On the continent, his rule projected the country as a regional power with diplomatic successes including the Abuja Treaty and the military engagement of Nigerian troops in Liberia and Sierra Leone.",

He later became founder and publisher of Nigerian Tribune of African Newspapers of Nigeria Ltd.[1] After receiving his bachelor of commerce degree in Nigeria, he traveled to London to pursue his degree in law.[2] Obafemi Awolowo was the first premier of the Western Region and later federal commissioner for finance, and vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council[3] during the Nigerian Civil War.[4] He was thrice a major contender for the country's highest office.[5]\n\nA native of Ikenne in Ogun State of south-western Nigeria,[6] Awolowo started his career, like some of his well-known contemporaries, as a nationalist in the Nigerian Youth Movement in which he rose to become Western Provincial Secretary.[1] Awolowo was responsible for much of the progressive social legislation that has made Nigeria a modern nation.[7] In 1963, he was tried and jailed for 10 years on charges of sedition.[8] He was pardoned by the government in 1966, after which he appointed the Minister of Finance.[9][10] In recognition of all of this, Awolowo was the first individual in the modern era to be named as the leader of the Yorubas (Yoruba: Asíwájú Àwọn Yorùbá or Asíwájú Ọmọ Oòduà).[11][12]",

It was renamed \"Obafemi Awolowo University\" on 12 May 1987, so by the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida led military administration, in honour of Obafemi Awolowo (1909–1987), the first premier of the Western Region of Nigeria, who initially thought of the idea of establishing the university.[4][5][6]\n\nIn 1951, with the adoption of a new constitution, major changes were made to elected legislators and regional Premiers in the regions.[7] Because they saw education as a key driver of change and development, the new regional administrations gave an extension of basic and secondary education priority. A commission was established by the Federal Minister of Education in 1959 to study the nation's projected needs for university graduates between 1960 and 1980.[8] The commission was headed by Cambridge lecturer Eric Ashby, a master at Clare College, Cambridge, and also included labour economist Frederick H. Harbison.[9] The expectation of the commission's final report by the  Western Region government was that the University of Ibadan would satisfy the needs of the Western Region, a position on which the federal government disagreed.[10] Before a final report was submitted in October 1960, the Western government began preparations for the establishment of a university in the region.[10]\n\nThe decision to establish the University of Ife[11] by the ruling Action Group party of the Western Region of Nigeria was in protest at the recommendations of the Ashby Report.[12][full citation needed] The first Nigerian university was established in 1948 at Ibadan in the Western Region as an external college of the University of London. The needs of Nigeria (then a British colony), however, exceeded the productivity of the country's only university. In particular, the University of Ibadan had no faculty of engineering or technology, law school, pharmacy school or management training abilities. The Ashby Commission, which was set up by the British, was to review the tertiary education needs of the soon-to-be-independent nation of Nigeria. The government of the Western Region did not want to rely on federal universities or those of other regions to admit its numerous secondary school leavers. The University at Ife was founded as a rebuttal to the perceived politicization of higher education opportunities in Nigeria and the Western Region and was designed to fill the gaps in manpower needs.",

They invaded the Awolowo Hall of the university at around 4:30 A.M., clad in black trousers and black T-shirts, their faces hidden by masks; they carried and used shotguns and hatchets against students.[3]\n\nAn account of what led to the massacre is given by Prof. Roger Makanjuola's book Water Must Flow Uphill (Adventures in University Administration). Makanjuola, following the massacre, became vice-chancellor of the university and took an active role in both investigating and punishing those from the university involved in the murders.[4]",

He joined Port Vale on loan in January 2017 and joined Colchester United on loan in January 2018. He made 13 appearances for QPR during the 2019–20 season, though he spent the following season on loan at Oxford United and was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday for the 2021–22 campaign. He joined Lincoln City on loan for the second half of the 2022–23 season and then signed for the club on a short-term deal in October 2023. He joined Portuguese club C.D. Feirense in January 2024.\n\nShodipo was born in Leixlip, on the outskirts of Dublin, Ireland, before moving to London at the age of two.[3][4] He signed a two-year contract extension with Queens Park Rangers in April 2016.[5] He made his senior debut  in the opening game of the 2016–17 EFL Championship season on 7 August 2016, in a 3–0 win over Leeds United at Loftus Road; he was named in the starting lineup, and was later substituted in the 68th minute for Abdenasser El Khayati.[6] Manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink later said that Shodipo had \"that rawness... that streetness and that fight\" and said \"we will definitely be putting him in and around the team regularly\".[7] On 30 November, Shodipo signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract with QPR, tying him to the club until 2019.[8] However, new manager Ian Holloway left him out of the team in favour of new signing Kazenga LuaLua, explaining his decision by saying \"every time I've put him on, unfortunately the team has let a goal in\"; Holloway said \"he would benefit massively from a loan spell\", which he hoped would improve the defensive and tactical side of his game.[9][10]",

CE), also called Adi Shankaracharya (Sanskrit: आदि शङ्कर, आदि शङ्कराचार्य, romanized: Ādi Śaṅkara, Ādi Śaṅkarācārya, lit. 'First Shankaracharya',[note 2] .mw-parser-output .IPA-label-small{font-size:85%}.mw-parser-output .references .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .infobox .IPA-label-small,.mw-parser-output .navbox .IPA-label-small{font-size:100%}pronounced [aːd̪i ɕɐŋkɐraːt͡ɕaːrjɐ]),[note 3] was an Indian Vedic scholar, philosopher and teacher (acharya) of Advaita Vedanta.[1] Reliable information on Shankara's actual life is scant,[2] and his true impact lies in his \"iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture,\" despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta.[3] Tradition also portrays him as the one who reconciled the various sects (Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and Shaktism) with the introduction of the Pañcāyatana form of worship, the simultaneous worship of five deities – Ganesha, Surya, Vishnu, Shiva and Devi, arguing that all deities were but different forms of the one Brahman, the invisible Supreme Being.[4]\n\nWhile he is often revered as the most important Indian philosopher, the historical influence of his works on Hindu intellectual thought has been questioned.[5][6][7] Until the 10th century Shankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Maṇḍana Miśra,[6][8] and there is no mention of him in concurrent Hindu, Buddhist or Jain sources until the 11th century.[9] The popular image of Shankara started to take shape in the 14th century, centuries after his death, when Sringeri matha started to receive patronage from the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire[8][10][11][12] and shifted their allegiance from Advaitic Agamic Shaivism to Brahmanical Advaita orthodoxy.[13] Hagiographies dating from the 14th-17th centuries deified him as a ruler-renunciate, travelling on a digvijaya (conquest of the four quarters)[14][15] across the Indian subcontinent to propagate his philosophy, defeating his opponents in theological debates.[16][17] These hagiographies portray him as founding four mathas (monasteries), and Adi Shankara also came to be regarded as the organiser of the Dashanami monastic order, and the unifier of the Shanmata tradition of worship. The title of Shankaracharya, used by heads of certain monasteries in India, is derived from his name.\n\nOwing to his later fame over 300 texts are attributed to him, including commentaries (Bhāṣya), introductory topical expositions (Prakaraṇa grantha) and poetry (Stotra).[18][19] However, most of these are likely to have been written by admirers, or pretenders, or scholars with an eponymous name.[20][21] Works known to have been written by Shankara himself are the Brahmasutrabhasya,[18] his commentaries on ten principal Upanishads,[18][20] his commentary on the Bhagavad Gita,[22] and the Upadeśasāhasrī.[23][24] The authenticity of Shankara as the author of Vivekacūḍāmaṇi has been questioned and mostly rejected by scholarship.[25][26]",

The earliest evidence for sectarian Rudra-Shiva worship appears with the Pasupata (early CE),[2] possibly owing to the Hindu synthesis, when many local traditions were aligned with the Vedic-Brahmanical fold.[10] The Pāśupata movement rapidly expanded throughout North India, giving rise to different forms of Shaivism, which led to the emergence of various tantric traditions.[2] Both devotional and monistic Shaivism became popular in the 1st millennium CE, rapidly becoming the dominant religious tradition of many Hindu kingdoms.[2] It arrived in Southeast Asia shortly thereafter, leading to the construction of thousands of Shaiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in these regions.[11][12]\n\nShaivism incorporates many sub-traditions ranging from devotional dualistic theism such as Shaiva Siddhanta to yoga-orientated monistic non-theism such as Kashmiri Shaivism.[13][14][15] Shaivite theology ranges from Shiva being the creator, preserver, and destroyer to being the same as the Atman (Self) within oneself and every living being. It is closely related to Shaktism, and some Shaivas worship in both Shiva and Shakti temples.[15] It is the Hindu tradition that most accepts ascetic life and emphasizes yoga, and encourages one to discover and be one with Shiva within.[13][14][16]",

He was raised vegetarian and later became a vegan.[6][7] He served in the Israeli army, and later studied at a Haredi yeshiva in Israel.[2]\n\nKeisar became a vegan after learning about the widespread animal welfare issues present in egg and dairy factory farms.[5] In 2015, he wrote the book Velifnei Iver (translated as Before the Blind, in reference to the commandment in the Book of Leviticus, \"Do not put a stumbling block before the blind\"). In the book he makes the case that eating meat and animal byproducts is no longer permitted according to Jewish sources, because of the cruelty inflicted on animals by the modern mass production of meat, dairy and eggs.[2] The book has also been translated into English.[8]",

When Thomas L. Woolwine resigned in June 1923, Keyes stepped into his position. A year later Keyes called upon 87 department employees to resign, and he reappointed only 27 of them to form his new team. During 1924 he caused the average length of a felony trial to be cut from 130 to 51 days.[1]\n\nIn 1926, Keyes brought felony charges against celebrity evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, her mother, and several others, alleging McPherson's reported kidnapping was a hoax.[2] However, in January the following year, the charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence.",

Under the influence of the Haskalah and the struggle for emancipation, as well as the intellectual and cultural ferment in urban centres, some gradually abandoned Yiddish in favor of German and developed new forms of Jewish religious life and cultural identity.[13]\n\nThroughout the centuries, Ashkenazim made significant contributions to Europe's philosophy, scholarship, literature, art, music, and science.[14][15][16][17]",

Buhari earned a taciturn reputation during the presidency of Shehu Shagari due to his leading troops in the Chadian–Nigerian War. Buhari was a main figure behind the 1983 Nigerian coup d'état which led to the overthrow of the Second Republic. Although not the ringleader, Buhari became head of the military junta amid a period of deep economic crisis and widespread corruption. Citing economic mismanagement and a lack of discipline under the civilian administration, Buhari adopted a strict and austere approach to governance, with a strong emphasis on discipline, anti-corruption, and economic recovery through what became known as the War Against Indiscipline (WAI). The authoritarian political system he created is known as Buharism. Ultimately, Buhari's rigid style of governance and strained economic measures led to growing dissatisfaction within the military. On 27 August 1985, he was overthrown in a palace coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nBuhari ran for president of Nigeria on the platform and support of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2003 and 2007, and on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) platform in 2011.[4] In December 2014, he emerged as the presidential candidate of[5] the All Progressives Congress party for the 2015 general election.[6] Buhari won the election, defeating incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan.[7] It was the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost a re-election bid. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. In February 2019, Buhari was re-elected, defeating his closest rival, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, by over 3 million votes.[8][9][10][11]",

Bukhari was an important military commander who participated in and led several military campaigns during the jihad of Usman dan Fodio.\n\nMuhammad Bukhari was born in Degel, a small town in the Hausa kingdom of Gobir. His father Usman dan Fodio was a noted Islamic scholar and preacher from the Fulani clan of Torodbe. His mother Aisha came from a family with a long tradition of scholarship.[1] Bukhari studied under his father, and his uncle, Abdullahi. Because he was raised in Abdullahi's house, Bukhari dedicated much of his life to his uncle. Among his other teachers was al-Mustafa bin Muhammad al-Turudi, a scribe for Usman, and the father of the Sokoto scholar Abd al-Qadir dan Tafa.[2][3]: 169\n\nBukhari was one of the eight commanders of the Sokoto jihad. He participated in campaigns in the southern region of the Sokoto Caliphate, including Nupe, alongside his cousin Muhammad Wani, Abdullahi's son.[3]: 52  He was also actively involved in the Gwandu campaigns, aimed at pacifying the region. In 1805, Bukhari joined Abdullahi's forces in a campaign against the Hausa kingdom of Kebbi. After the fall of Birnin-Kebbi, the Sarkin Kebbi, Muhammadu Hodi, fled the capital. However, in 1816, Hodi mounted a fierce resistance against the Caliphate from his strongholds in Kimba, Augi, and Argungu, which ultimately ended in 1826 when he was killed by Bukhari.[4]: 248–249",

Al-Bukhari's extant works include the hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari, al-Tarikh al-Kabir, and al-Adab al-Mufrad.\n\nBorn in Bukhara in present-day Uzbekistan, Al-Bukhari began learning hadith at a young age. He travelled across the Abbasid Caliphate and learned under several influential contemporary scholars. Bukhari memorized thousands of hadith narrations, compiling the Sahih al-Bukhari in 846. He spent the rest of his life teaching the hadith he had collected. Towards the end of his life, Bukhari faced claims the Quran was created, and was exiled from Nishapur. Subsequently, he moved to Khartank, near Samarkand.\n\nSahih al-Bukhari is revered as the most important hadith collection in Sunni Islam. Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, the hadith collection of Al-Bukhari's student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, are together known as the Sahihayn (Arabic: صحيحين, romanized: Saḥiḥayn) and are regarded by Sunnis as the most authentic books after the Quran.

It was renamed \"Obafemi Awolowo University\" on 12 May 1987, so by the Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida led military administration, in honour of Obafemi Awolowo (1909–1987), the first premier of the Western Region of Nigeria, who initially thought of the idea of establishing the university.[4][5][6]\n\nIn 1951, with the adoption of a new constitution, major changes were made to elected legislators and regional Premiers in the regions.[7] Because they saw education as a key driver of change and development, the new regional administrations gave an extension of basic and secondary education priority. A commission was established by the Federal Minister of Education in 1959 to study the nation's projected needs for university graduates between 1960 and 1980.[8] The commission was headed by Cambridge lecturer Eric Ashby, a master at Clare College, Cambridge, and also included labour economist Frederick H. Harbison.[9] The expectation of the commission's final report by the  Western Region government was that the University of Ibadan would satisfy the needs of the Western Region, a position on which the federal government disagreed.[10] Before a final report was submitted in October 1960, the Western government began preparations for the establishment of a university in the region.[10]\n\nThe decision to establish the University of Ife[11] by the ruling Action Group party of the Western Region of Nigeria was in protest at the recommendations of the Ashby Report.[12][full citation needed] The first Nigerian university was established in 1948 at Ibadan in the Western Region as an external college of the University of London. The needs of Nigeria (then a British colony), however, exceeded the productivity of the country's only university. In particular, the University of Ibadan had no faculty of engineering or technology, law school, pharmacy school or management training abilities. The Ashby Commission, which was set up by the British, was to review the tertiary education needs of the soon-to-be-independent nation of Nigeria. The government of the Western Region did not want to rely on federal universities or those of other regions to admit its numerous secondary school leavers. The University at Ife was founded as a rebuttal to the perceived politicization of higher education opportunities in Nigeria and the Western Region and was designed to fill the gaps in manpower needs.",

Awolowo founded the Yoruba nationalist group Egbe Omo Oduduwa as well as the Premier of the Western Region under Nigeria's parliamentary system from 1952 to 1959. He was the official opposition leader in the federal parliament to the Balewa government from 1959 to 1963.\n\nAs a young man he was an active journalist, editing publications such as the Nigerian Worker and the African Sentinel, on top of others as well. He later became founder and publisher of Nigerian Tribune of African Newspapers of Nigeria Ltd.[1] After receiving his bachelor of commerce degree in Nigeria, he traveled to London to pursue his degree in law.[2] Obafemi Awolowo was the first premier of the Western Region and later federal commissioner for finance, and vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council[3] during the Nigerian Civil War.[4] He was thrice a major contender for the country's highest office.[5]\n\nA native of Ikenne in Ogun State of south-western Nigeria,[6] Awolowo started his career, like some of his well-known contemporaries, as a nationalist in the Nigerian Youth Movement in which he rose to become Western Provincial Secretary.[1] Awolowo was responsible for much of the progressive social legislation that has made Nigeria a modern nation.[7] In 1963, he was tried and jailed for 10 years on charges of sedition.[8] He was pardoned by the government in 1966, after which he appointed the Minister of Finance.[9][10] In recognition of all of this, Awolowo was the first individual in the modern era to be named as the leader of the Yorubas (Yoruba: Asíwájú Àwọn Yorùbá or Asíwájú Ọmọ Oòduà).[11][12]",

Buhari earned a taciturn reputation during the presidency of Shehu Shagari due to his leading troops in the Chadian–Nigerian War. Buhari was a main figure behind the 1983 Nigerian coup d'état which led to the overthrow of the Second Republic. Although not the ringleader, Buhari became head of the military junta amid a period of deep economic crisis and widespread corruption. Citing economic mismanagement and a lack of discipline under the civilian administration, Buhari adopted a strict and austere approach to governance, with a strong emphasis on discipline, anti-corruption, and economic recovery through what became known as the War Against Indiscipline (WAI). The authoritarian political system he created is known as Buharism. Ultimately, Buhari's rigid style of governance and strained economic measures led to growing dissatisfaction within the military. On 27 August 1985, he was overthrown in a palace coup led by General Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nBuhari ran for president of Nigeria on the platform and support of the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in 2003 and 2007, and on the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) platform in 2011.[4] In December 2014, he emerged as the presidential candidate of[5] the All Progressives Congress party for the 2015 general election.[6] Buhari won the election, defeating incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan.[7] It was the first time in the history of Nigeria that an incumbent president lost a re-election bid. He was sworn in on 29 May 2015. In February 2019, Buhari was re-elected, defeating his closest rival, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, by over 3 million votes.[8][9][10][11]",

He played college football for the Ohio State Buckeyes, earning second-team All-American honors in 2015. Elliott was selected by the Dallas Cowboys fourth overall in the 2016 NFL draft. In his first seven NFL seasons, all with the Cowboys, he was a three-time Pro Bowl, two-time All-Pro selection, and led the league in rushing yards in 2016 and 2018. After being released by the Cowboys after the 2022 season, Elliott played the 2023 season for the New England Patriots before re-signing with the Cowboys in 2024.\n\nElliott was born in Alton, Illinois, to a mother and father who were both athletes in college.[1] His mother, the former Dawn Huff, was a high school state champion in three sports before attending the University of Missouri and running track there.[2][3] His father, Stacy, was a linebacker for the Missouri football team and CEO of Fifth Down Enterprises.[4] Elliott's maternal grandfather played basketball for Drake University.[2] His uncle is Finnish professional basketball player Shawn Huff.[2]\n\nDespite his athletic pedigree, Elliott attended more academically driven John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri,[5][6] where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball, and track and field.

Born in Accra, Ghana, he moved to the United States to attend Brigham Young University, where he played college football for the Brigham Young Cougars. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions fifth overall in the 2013 NFL draft.\n\nAnsah grew up playing soccer and had never seen American football as a youth.[1]  In addition to soccer, Ansah was also an enthusiastic basketball fan.  He regularly played pickup basketball games at Golden Sunbeam Montessori School where he attended from 4th grade to 9th grade. He developed his basketball interests and abilities on a turf donated by Forever Young Foundation (Steve Young). Ansah played on the Golden Sunbeam basketball team and became the most valuable player and led his team to win many games. Because of the school's basketball facility, attention was drawn from basketball enthusiasts including missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). It was at these pickup basketball games with missionaries and students that Ansah developed a friendship with a missionary. Ansah was later baptized a member of the church at age 18.[1][2] A missionary, who taught and baptized Ansah, kept in touch with Ansah after returning to the United States. The missionary later suggested that if he was serious about basketball, Ansah should come to Brigham Young University and try out for the basketball team.[1]\n\nAnsah joined the Presbyterian Boys' Senior Secondary School, Legon in 2004. He studied business. During his stay in the school, Ansah actively participated in sports, playing an active role in the basketball team while also participating in track and field sports. During his stay in high school, he was a resident of Kwansa House. He graduated from high school in June 2007 and returned to Golden Sunbeam as a teaching assistant where, in his spare time, he trained the pupils in basketball.",

He was then signed by WWE in 2007 and sent to their then-developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling, under the new ring name Rycklon, which was later changed to Ezekiel Jackson after his main-roster debut in 2008. During his time in WWE, Jackson was the final man to win the ECW Championship, his only professional wrestling world championship, making him the third African American to hold the ECW championship, the sixth black world champion (after The Rock, Booker T, Bobby Lashley, Ron Simmons, and Mark Henry), and the first South American -born champion in WWE history. He later joined The Corre but was kicked out, thus starting a feud with the stable's leader Wade Barrett and he would go on to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship once.\n\nJackson would leave WWE in 2014 and briefly wrestle for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) later that year. He also competed in one season of Lucha Underground from 2014 to 2015 as Big Ryck.

Rawlins is a half African-American private investigator, a hard-boiled detective, and World War II veteran living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. He is featured in a series of best-selling mysteries set from the 1940s to the 1960s.[citation needed]\n\nThe mysteries combine traditional conventions of detective fiction with descriptions of racial inequities and social injustice experienced by African Americans and other persons of color in the Los Angeles of that period. While Rawlins is clearly in the tradition of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer, he differs sharply from these earlier fictional detectives in that Rawlins is an unlicensed private investigator (though he acquires a license late in the series) with no background or training in law enforcement.[citation needed]\n\nMosley has written fourteen novels and a collection of short stories featuring Rawlins, his most popular character. Mosley originally featured Rawlins in a novella called Gone Fishin', but it was rejected by several publishers because they didn't think that there was a market for books about black men. When Mosley rewrote the story as a detective novel, he found a publisher.[1]",

In 1845, he published The Death of Capt. Nathan Hall: A Drama in Five Acts.[2] In the same year he was ordained at Norwich, Conn., as a foreign missionary on June 13, 1845.",

He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1846 and served in the Mexican–American War.\n\nJones was appointed a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on June 17, 1861. He commanded a brigade in Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard's Confederate Army of the Potomac at the First Battle of Bull Run. Jones was sent to the Richmond area afterwards to serve under Maj. Gen John B. Magruder's command, and he was promoted to major general on March 10, 1862. In the Seven Days Battles, he temporarily led the division when Magruder served as a wing commander. When Magruder departed for the Western Theater in July, Jones got permanent command, leading his troops at Second Battle of Bull Run and the Battle of Antietam, in both cases under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet. Jones became the highest ranking division commander in the Army of Northern Virginia after Maj. Gen Richard Ewell was wounded at Groveton on August 28.",

Trampier was also the creator of the Wormy comic strip that ran in Dragon magazine for several years.\n\nAt the height of his career in the late 1980s, Trampier suddenly withdrew from the gaming world and became a social recluse. Although the reasons for this break were unclear, a disagreement with TSR is possible; it is clear that later in life, Trampier wanted nothing to do with TSR or its successor, Wizards of the Coast. For many years, Trampier's location was unknown to anyone and rumors circulated that he had died; his brother-in-law Tom Wham denied this, although Wham admitted that even he did not know where Trampier was or what he was doing.\n\nTrampier was inducted into the AAGAD (tabletop gaming) Hall of Fame posthumously in 2024 as part of the 50th Anniversary of the HOF.[2]",
